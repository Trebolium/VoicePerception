For reproducing the paper [Learning Disentangled Representations of Timbre and Pitch for Musical Instrument Sounds Using Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08152?fbclid=IwAR3yBPx71nPt0uO6GjVqdJxQxzStiyz3osf6mFUCW_cMIarwykZM5_tfUpU).

The repo is based on the (old) [project template](https://github.com/victoresque/pytorch-template).

# Reproducing steps
1. Download the dataset from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3833974#.XsUiWi2B3OQ).
   Put the folder `data` at the root of this repo.
2. run `python train.py -c config.json`

The checkpoint `model_best.pth` will be saved at `saved/gmvae-synth`.
After the training completes, 
play with `ismir19-217-sup-material.ipynb` to see the results.

# Details missing from the paper
A pitch classifier which takes as input the pitch latent variable is added on top of the pitch space.

# Note
- In provided dataset, `spec` and `spec-norm` refer to the extracted mel-spectrograms and the normalized ones.
- The configuration of `config.json` refers to the fully-supervised model in the paper,
  which is also the model used for controllable synthesis and timbre transfer.
  In `config.json`, change the `label_portion` under the `trainer` tag to train a semi-supervised model.
